## 📋 Project Overview (Short description of the system)
This project is a Document Management System (DMS) designed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. The system allows users to manage digital documents through core functionalities like creation, printing, modification, and saving.

It provides a simple yet extendable architecture that enables users to interact with Document objects in an intuitive and consistent manner.

### ✨ Key Features
Each Document objects have the following methods:
- 📑 **Create Method**: Initializes and stores a new document in the system with user-defined content and metadata
- ✏️ **Print Method**: Displays the current content of the document in a readable format via the console
- 🛠️ **Modify Method**: Allows users to edit or update the content of an existing document
- 📤 **Save Method**: Automatically handles saving the document to a file or persistent storage, ensuring no data is lost between sessions

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Design Pattern**: Object-Oriented Programming
- **Classes**:
  - `Document`: Base class representing document objects
  - `Spreadsheet`: Represents tabular data documents
  - `Slideshow`: Represents presentation-style documents with slides
  - `Email`: Represents digital correspondence documents with sender, recipient, and subject
  - `Letter`: Represents written communication in document form
